# From Zero to Elastic Certified Engineer

My name is Peter and I will be sharing my preparation to become \(or not\) [Elastic Certified Engineer](https://www.elastic.co/training/certification). I'm a little bit experienced already and trying to share my knowledge on [my blog](https://programistanaswoim.pl/kategoria/programowanie/uczymy-sie/elastic-stack/) \(in Polish\) and help others on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/4086321/piotr-pradzynski). But not so experienced to go to [the exam](https://training.elastic.co/exam/elastic-certified-engineer) at once. Here, in this GitBook, I am planning to keep notes around my preparation based on [the objectives](https://training.elastic.co/exam/elastic-certified-engineer#objectives). No matter if I will take the exam or not I hope to learn something new and share the notes with you.
